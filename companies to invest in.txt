Strengths
WPF/BOA. Being thorough and sticking with the task until it is done, not just the first time 
the code runs without crashing.

Weaknesses
Not very good at documenting, creating crucible pages as well as
 personal notes
Need to be better about taking the initiative to make things happen

Long and short term goals
Finish Item Status/ finish Comps. We are way to quick to abandon months of work by people.

If we don't want to finish it then we need to think alot deeper when assigning work to people
